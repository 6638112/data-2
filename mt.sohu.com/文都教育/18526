<p><strong>PART I Writing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong> For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay on online dictionaries. You can start your essay with the sentence <strong>"Online dictionaries</strong> <strong>are becoming increasingly popular. " </strong>You should write at least 120 words but no more than 180 words.</p>
<p><strong>参考范文：</strong></p>
<p>With the growing popularity of smartphones and the high coverage rate of wireless network, online dictionaries are becoming increasingly popular for students in daily study. It seems to be a trend that online dictionaries would replace paper ones. However, just as the saying goes, “different strokes for different folks.”</p>
<p>Some students are more prone to use online dictionaries and have two points to support it. First, online dictionaries are more portable, and make it possible to look up any new words that we met anytime and anywhere only via a small phone in our hands. Second, we can improve both written and oral skills, as online dictionaries allow us to hear the native pronunciation of each word clearly. Whereas others hold differently. They are still in favor of use print ones. For one thing, paper dictionaries can protect our eyesight better than online ones as digital devices may emit radiation if we watch the electronic screen for a long time. For another, using the print dictionary can prevent us from being distracted by reminders of irrelevant information.</p>
<p>As far as I’m concerned, although the content of paper dictionaries is authoritative, its lexicon is not updated as quickly as online ones. After all, we live in an information age and can have access to many hot words on the Internet every day.</p>

<p><strong>【Conversation one】</strong> <strong>牛津大学物理学教授的访谈</strong></p>
<p>M：You are a professor of physics at the university of Oxford. You're a senior advisor at the European organization for nuclear research. You also seem to tour the globe tirelessly giving talks. And In addition, you have your own weekly TV show on science. Where do you get the energy?</p>
<p>W：Oh,well, I just love what I do. I am extremely fortunate life doing what I love doing.</p>
<p>M：Professor, what exactly is your goal? Why do you do all of this?</p>
<p>W：Well, As you said, I do have different things going on. But these, I think, can be divided into two groups. The education of science and the further understanding of science.</p>
<p>M：Don't these two things get in the way of each other? What I mean is, doesn't giving lectures take time away from the lab?</p>
<p>W：Not really. No, I love teaching. And I don't mind spending more time doing that now than in the past. Also what I will say is that teaching a subject helps me comprehend it better myself. I find that it furthers my own knowledge when I have to explain something clearly. When I have to aid others in understanding it. And when I have to answer questions about it, teaching at a high level can be very stimulating. One, no matter how much expertise they may already have in the field, they are instructing</p>            <div class="lookall-box">

<p>M：any scientific breakthroughs that you see on the near horizon? a significant discovery on venture. And we can expect soon?</p>
<p>W：the world is always conducting science and there are constantly new things being discovered. In fact, right now we have too much data sitting in computers. For example, we have thousands of photos of planet mars taken by telescopes that nobody has ever seen. We have them yet. Nobody has had time to look at them with their own eyes, let alone analyze them.</p>
<p><strong>Questions one to four are based on the conversation you have just heard.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1. Why does the woman say she can be so energetic?</strong></p>
<p><strong>答案：Oh,well, I just love what I do.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 2. What has the woman been engaged in?</strong></p>
<p><strong>答案：The education of science and the further understanding of science.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 3. What does the woman say about the benefit teaching brings to her?</strong></p>
<p><strong>答案：teaching a subject helps me comprehend it better myself</strong></p>

<p><strong>【Conversation Two】对于梦的起源的探讨</strong></p>
<p>M：Do you think dreams have special meanings?</p>
<p>W：No, I don't think they do.</p>
<p>M：Don't either. But some people do. I would say people who believe that dreams have meanings are superstitious, especially nowadays, in the past, during the times of ancient Egypt, Greece or China, people used to believe that dreams could foresee the future. But today, with all the scientific knowledge that we have, I think it's much harder to believe in these sorts of things.</p>
<p>W：My grandmother is superstitious, and she thinks dreams can predict the future. Once she dreamed that the flight she was due to take the following day crashed, can you guess what she did? She didn't take that flight. She didn't even bother to go to the airport the following day. Instead she took the same flight. But a week later, everything was fine. Of course, no plane ever crashed.</p>
<p>M：How funny did you know that flying is actually safer than any other mode of transport? It's been statistically proven. People can be so irrational sometimes.</p>
<p>W：Yes, absolutely. But even if we think they are ridiculous, emotions can be just as powerful as rational thinking.</p>
<p>M：Exactly. People do all sorts of crazy things because of their irrational feelings. But in fact, some psychologists believe that our dreams are the result of our emotions and memories from that day. I think it was Sigmund Freud who said that children's dreams were usually simple representations of their wishes, things they wished would happen. But in adults, dreams a much more complicated reflections of their more sophisticated sentiments.</p>
<p>W：Isn't it interesting how psychologists try to understand using the scientific method something as bizarre as dreams? Psychology is like the rational study of irrational feelings.</p>
<p><strong>Questions five to eight are based on the conversation you have just heard.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 5. What do both speakers think of dreams?</strong></p>
<p><strong>答案：they don’t have special meanings</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 6. Why didn't the woman's grandmother take her scheduled flight?</strong></p>
<p><strong>答案：Once she dreamed that the flight she was due to take the following day crashed</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 7. What does the woman say about people's emotions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>答案：emotions can be just as powerful as rational thinking.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 8. What did psychologist Sigmund Freud say about adults dreams?</strong></p>
<p><strong>答案：But in adults, dreams a much more complicated reflections of their more sophisticated sentiments.</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Passage One】南极考察队对于V湖冰面下生物的探索</strong></p>
<p>While some scientists explore the surface of Antarctica, others are learning more about a giant body of water four kilometers beneath the ice pack.</p>
<p>Scientists first discovered lake Voss dock in the 19 seventy's by using radio waves that penetrate the ice. Since then, they have used sound waves and even satellites to map this massive body of water. How does the water in lake Voss dog remain liquid beneath an ice sheet? The thick glacier above acts like an insulating blanket and keeps the water from freezing, says Martin Siegert, a glaciologist from the university of Wales. In addition, geothermal heat from deep within the earth may warm the hidden lake. The scientists suspect that microorganisms may be living in lake vohs stock closed off from the outside world for more than 2 million years.</p>
<p>Anything found there will be totally alien to what's on the surface of the earth to see a good scientists are trying to find a way to drill into the ice and draw water samples without causing contamination. Again, robots might be the solution. If all goes as planned, a drill shaped robot will through the surface eyes. When it reaches the lake, it will release another robot that can swim in the lake, take pictures, and look for signs of life. The scientists hope their discoveries will shed light on life in outer space, which might exist in similar dark and airless conditions.</p>
<p>Recently, close up pictures of jupiter, as moon europa shows signs of water beneath its icy surface. Once tested in antarctica, robots could be sent to europa to search for life there too.</p>

He could did a tribe member through a social worker who worked with the tribesmen in Mexico. At first, the tribe member named gonzales was very reluctant to cooperate.

<p>【<strong>recording one</strong>】 <strong>到底什么是激进?女权主义是激进嘛?</strong></p>
<p>What is a radical? It seems today that people are terrified of the term, particularly of having the label attached to them. Accusing individuals or groups of being radical often serves to silence them into submission, thereby maintaining the existing state of affairs, and more important, preserving the power of a select minority who are mostly wealthy white males in western society.</p>
<p>Feminism is a perfect example of this phenomenon. The women's movement has been plagued by stereotypes, misrepresentations by the media, and accusations of man hating and radicalism. When the basic foundation of feminism is simply that women deserve equal rights in all facets of life, when faced with a threat of being labeled radical women back down from their worthy cause and consequently participate in their own oppression, it has gotten to the point that many women are afraid to call themselves feminists because of the stigma attached to the word. If people refuse to be controlled and intimidated by stigma, as the stigma as lose all their power, without fear and which to feed such stigma as can only die. To me, a radical is simply someone who rebels against the norm. What advocates a change in the existing state of affairs? On closer inspection, it becomes clear that the norm is constantly involving and therefore is not a constant entity.</p>
<p>So why there is deviation from the present situation? Such a threat than the state of affairs itself is unstable. And subject to relentless transformation, it all goes back to maintaining the power of those who have it and preventing the rise of those who don't. In fact, when we look at the word radical in a historical context, nearly every figure we now hold up as a hero was considered a radical in his or her time. Radicals are people who affect change. They are the people about whom history is written. Abolitionists were radicals. Civil rights activists were radicals, even the founders of our country in their fight to win independence from England or radicals. Their presence in history has changed the way our society functions, mainly by shifting the balance of power that previously existed. There are some radicals who have made a negative impact on humanity. But undeniably, there would simply be no progress without radicals. That being said, next time someone calls me a radical, I will accept that label with pride.</p>
<p><strong>Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 16. What usually happens when people are accused of being radical?</strong></p>
<p><strong>答案：preserving the power of a select minority who are mostly wealthy white males in western society.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 17. What is the speaker's definition of a radical?</strong></p>
<p><strong>答案：a radical is simply someone who rebels against the norm.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 18. What does the speaker think of most radicals in the American history?</strong></p>
<p><strong>答案：there would simply be no progress without radicals.</strong></p>
<p>【<strong>Recording two</strong>】<strong>人的社会性因素：不可避免的被环境影响</strong></p>
<p>We are very susceptible to the influence of the people around us. For instance, you may have known somebody who has gone overseas for a year or so and has returned with an accent. Perhaps. We become part of our immediate environment. None of us are immune to the influences of our own world.</p>
<p>And let us not kid ourselves that we are untouched by the things and the people in our life.</p>
<p>Fred goes off to his new job at a factory. Fred takes his 10 minute coffee break, but the other workers take a half an hour. Fred says, what's the matter with you guys? Two weeks later, Fred is taking 20 minute breaks. A month later, Fred takes his half hour. Fred is saying, if you can't beat them, join them, why should I work any harder than the next guy?</p>
<p>The fascinating thing about being human is that generally we are unaware that there are changes taking place in our mentality. It is like returning to the city smog after some weeks in the fresh air. Only then do we realize that we have become accustomed to the nasty smells mix with critical people. And we learn to criticize mixed with happy people. And we learn about happiness. What this means is that we need to decide what we want from life and then choose our company accordingly.</p>
<p>You may well say that is going to take some effort. It may not be comfortable. I may offend some of my present company. Right? But it is your life. Fred may say I'm always broke frequently depressed. I'm going nowhere and I never do anything exciting. Then we discover that friends, best friends, are always broke, frequently depressed, going nowhere and wishing that life was more exciting. This is not coincidence. Nor is it our business to stand in judgment of Fred. However, if Fred ever wants to improve his quality of life, the first thing he'll need to do is recognize what has been going on all these years. It's no surprise that doctors as a profession suffer a lot of ill health because they spend their lives around sick people. Psychiatrists have a higher incidence of suicide in their profession for related reasons.</p>
<p>Traditionally, nine out of tension, whose parents' smoke smoke themselves. Obesity is in part an environmental problem. Successful people have successful friends. And so the story goes on.</p>

<p><strong>答案：It is like returning to the city smog after some weeks in the fresh air</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 21.What does the speaker say about psychiatrists?</strong></p>
<p><strong>答案：Psychiatrists have a higher incidence of suicide in their profession for related reasons.</strong></p>
<p>【<strong>Recording three</strong>】 <strong>美元的发展历史(这玩意有啥可说的?</strong></p>
<p>Virtually every American can recognize a dollar bill at a mere glance. Many can identify it by its sound or texture. But few people indeed can accurately describe the world's most powerful, important currency. The American dollar bill is colored with black ink on one side and green on the other. The exact composition of the paper and ink is a closely guarded government secret. Despite its weighty importance, the dollar bill actually weighs little. It requires nearly 500 bills to tip the scales at a pound. Not only is the dollar bill lightweight, but it also has a brief lifespan. Few dollar bills survive longer. 18 months.</p>
<p>The word dollar is taken from the German word, tailor the name for the world's most important currency in the 16th century.</p>
<p>The Thaler was a silver coin first minted in 1518 under the reign of Charles the 5th, emperor of Germany.</p>
<p>The concept of paper money is a relatively recent innovation in the history of American currency. When the constitution was signed, people had little regard for paper money because of its steadily decreasing value during the colonial era. Because of this lack of faith, the new American government minted only coins for common currency. Interest bearing bank notes were issued at the same time. But their purpose was limited to providing money for urgent government crises, such as American involvement in the war of 1812. The first non interest bearing paper currency was authorized by congress in 1862. At the height of the civil war. At this point, citizens, old fears of devalued paper currency had calmed. The dollar bill was born. The new green colored paper money quickly earned the nickname greenback. Today, the American dollar bill is a product of the federal reserve and is issued from the 12 federal reserve banks around the United States. The government keeps a steady supply of approximately 2 billion bills in circulation at all times.</p>
<p>Controversy continues to surround the true value of the dollar bill.</p>
<p>American history has seen generations of politicians argue in favor of a gold standard for American currency. However, for the present, the American dollar bill holds the value that is printed on it and little more. The only other guarantee on the bill is a federal reserve pledge as a confirmation in the form of government securities.</p>
<p><strong>Questions 22 to 25 are based on the recording you have just heard.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 22. What does the speaker say about the American dollar bill?</strong></p>
<p><strong>答案：The American dollar bill is colored with black ink on one side and green on the other</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 23. What does the speaker say about the exact composition of the American dollar bill?</strong></p>
<p><strong>答案： a closely guarded government secret.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 24. Why did the new American government mint only coins for common currency?</strong></p>
<p><strong>答案：because of its steadily decreasing value during the colonial era. Because of this lack of faith</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 25. What have generations of American politicians argued for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>答案：in favor of a gold standard for American currency</strong></p>

<p>中秋遇国庆，欢度双节，喜悦双倍，美食不可少，特别是年年赏月必备的月饼，你最喜欢的是五仁月饼？还是咸蛋黄月饼？</p>
<p>但是，小编要告诉你们，这些口味的月饼已经OUT了，今年各大高校牌的月饼必须有牌面，超高的颜值，新奇的口感，你值得拥有！</p>
<p><strong>西安科技大学高新学院</strong></p>
<p>历时半个多月的筹备，西安科技大学高新学院共制作了12种口味，3万多块的月饼送给了12000多名师生。</p>
<p class="ql-align-center"><img src="http://p0.itc.cn/images01/20200921/bbd05a30f2d94757bd80ac43fbb3e0f2.png" max-width="600"><span class="img-desc" style="font-size: 16px;">（截图自搜狐视频）</span></img></p>
<p>除了常规八种口味，更是推出了冰峰经典豆沙、油泼辣子咸蛋黄、腊牛肉五仁、长安葫芦鸡等四款陕西风味月饼，真是太有陕北特色了~</p>
<p><strong>天津大学</strong></p>

<p>除限量礼盒之外，还有校徽经典礼盒和广式传统礼盒，多种口味的选择，充分满足了师生的味蕾，小编隔着屏幕都能感受到月饼的美味了~</p>
<p><strong>兰州大学</strong></p>
<p>如果月饼界有选美大赛，那么兰州大学的月饼绝对能多的桂冠！今年兰州大学更加注重月饼的颜值和口味上，快来先睹为快~吃不到也可以饱饱眼福呀！</p>

<p>不同口味的月饼上都有不同的兰州大学特色图案，无论是月饼的颜色，还是口味都是满满的小清新，是年轻学生的style。</p>
<p><strong>同济大学</strong></p>
<p>小编以为12种口味的月饼，已经是高校牌月饼的“天花板”了，没想到被同济大学37种口味的月饼“啪啪打脸”。</p>
<p>同济大学食堂今年一口气推出了32款包括苏式、广式、桃山皮等月饼，更有蟹粉鲜肉、松茸鲜肉、咖喱牛肉等五种创新口味，光听着名字就流口水~</p>
<p class="ql-align-center"><img src="http://p3.itc.cn/images01/20200921/1c41ad3980ef4a3897e55e65c3972048.png" max-width="600"><span class="img-desc" style="font-size: 16px;">（图片来自同济大学微博）</span></img></p>

<p>四川外国语大学也规定了，缺考7月或者9月四六级的同学，取消12月报考资格。</p>
<p>所以，具体还是以高校规定为准，请同学们密切关注教务处通知！</p>
<p>2、9月四六级成绩11月才出，不知道分数还怎么报考12月四六级？？</p>
<p>辽宁传媒学院的通知中增加了一项补报时间：即如果你9月的的四级过了，在11月底还可以补报六级！</p>
<p>①对于已报考9月19日英语四级，但没有在9月24日-10月10日报名六级的同学，如果四级超过425分，可予以一次补报六级笔试考试的机会。</p>
<p>②补报时间：2020年11月底</p>
