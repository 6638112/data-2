<p>六级口语考试是为了考查大家的英语语言综合运用能力，尤其是在个人陈述和互动讨论环节，考查灵活度更高，要求我们短时间内做好准备应答。本场的个人陈述主题是围绕“医疗服务”展开的，要求先陈述医疗服务的变化，然后就“线上医疗好还是线下医疗好”展开论述。随着今年年初新冠疫情的暴发，与医疗相关的话题热度居高不下，同时医疗又与人们的身体健康息息相关，下面小编就来带大家看看围绕这一话题可以展开的相关表述：</p>
<p><strong>Online medical service or offline medical service, which is better?</strong></p>
<p>Nowadays, with the development of Internet and medical technology, it has become a reality that we can stay at home to be medically served online without going to the physical hospital. Personally, I think the online medical service is better that the traditional one for the following three main points.</p>
<p>Firstly, as is known to us, the traditional medical service required that we should not only make an appointment in advance, but also go to the physical hospital to line up for a long time to see the doctor. What’s worse, it takes a few hours for us to get there if we are far from the hospital. Thus, the online one can be said to be better and convenient for us. We can make use of the waiting time to do a lot of meaningful things or get more sleep. Second, as the pandemic of CIVID-19 this year, some measures should be taken to reduce the probability of exposing to the infectious disease. However, if we all go to the physical hospital when we feel a little sick, we can’t guarantee the occurrence of infection since some diseases is contagious itself. Lastly, I suggest that common ailments, such as catching a cold, should be encouraged to be treated online at home, while the unusual cases should be treated in the hospital because sometimes we need to be inspected by the professional medical devices to know our physical condition. </p>

<p>The Importance of Translation</p>
<p>Translation is a cross-language and cross-culture communicative activity. In translation practice, translators should be faithful to the original text, and deal with target language with flexibility, instead of sticking to the original structure. As Eugene Nida said, “Translating consists in reproducing in the receptor language the closest natural equivalent of the source language message, first in terms of meaning, and secondly in terms of style.” Translation plays a key role in a increasingly interdependent world.</p>
<p>With the globalization of the economic, there are more and more global companies, who need the translator when they communicate with their business partner, run a business in a foreign country, and so on. The translator enhance communication by conveying information accurately from one language to another in different countries across the world. </p>
<p>To sum up, translation is not just about academic skills. It is about providing the vital linguistic and cultural link between persons and communities of different races, cultures and languages. So that we can communicate better and understand one another more effectively. </p>

<p>People now are living in an era of technology. With the rapid development of the Internet, we can get information in a much faster way than ever before. The Internet allows for an unbelievably large amount of downloads and uploads of information for individual users. However, it also brings about the hazard of personal information leakage, and it is vital to raise people’s awareness of this serious problem. Firstly, if the personal information gets revealed, it might be obtained and utilized by some people who intend to engage in illegal activities, such as fraud, forgery, even kidnapping. It will cause immeasurable losses to the victims, and everyone’s safety cannot be guaranteed under this circumstance. Besides, if some business giants possess a considerable amount of personal information, they might become dominant in a industry to an extent that monopoly might be formed, which obviously has a negative impact on the whole market, even the economy. Thus, personal information protection is an alarmingly significant issue that cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>Despite the convenience that science and technology has brought into life, people nowadays tend to feel more lonely than in the past. And loneliness can cause a number of damages to both physical and mental health. According to a medical research, people who often feel lonely tend to have a weaker immune system, thus they have a much higher level of blood pressure than average, and are more likely to get chronic diseases like brain damage, heart disease, even cancer. Researchers believe that loneliness can cause changes in hormone levels, which is responsible for these physical illnesses that lonely people suffer. Not only that, loneliness can result in many significant damages to people’s mental health as well. For example, people who often feel lonely might find themselves difficult to concentrate and think deeply. Without self-adjusting, they might lose interests toward their job, friends and things which they used to love, and are in danger of falling into depression eventually. Considering the damaging effects loneliness can bring about to people’s lives, it is necessary for us to avoid this harmful emotion, and help whoever is experiencing it.</p>

<p>Candidate B: Well, when I walked out of the dorm today, there was a car parked in front of the door, which made it difficult for students to get in and out.</p>
<p>Candidate A: Oh, the owner of the car is so incompetent, how can he park his car there?</p>
<p>Candidate B: So I don’t think people can leave their cars random on campus, instead, they should park them in a fixed parking space.</p>
<p>Candidate A: Yeah, I agree with you. So it is necessary to charge car owners for disorderly parking.</p>
<p>Candidate B: You mean that if the owner parks his car in a fixed parking space, and it will not affect the traffic, so there will be no charge?</p>
<p>Candidate A: Yes. This would encourage owners to put their cars in the right places and penalize those who leave them in the wrong places.</p>
<p>Candidate B: Well, it sounds great! I believe that if our university does this, both students and teachers will get great convenience, thus reducing a lot of unnecessary troubles. </p>

<p>Candidate A: Due to the epidemic this year, many paper tests have been converted to computer-based ones. Do you have any ideas about it?</p>
<p>Candidate B: Yeah. I have just taken a computer-based test last month. I think it is very convenient and efficient. I just need to open my computer and do the test.</p>
<p>Candidate A: Well, of course computer-based test can reduce many processes, but does it guarantee fairness and equality of the test? </p>
<p>Candidate B: As far as I am concerned, computer-based test can’t fully guarantee the fairness of the examination. For example, the rural network is worse than the urban network, which is very unfair to the rural candidates.</p>
<p>Candidate A: Yeah, I agree with your idea. In addition, it’s not very safe. If the computer crashes or the Internet is disconnected, the exam will not go smoothly.</p>
<p>Candidate B: What’s more, popularizing the computer-based test is not simple. It requires sufficient funding and technical support. </p>
<p>Candidate A: So, In the future of artificial intelligence, computer-based tests may replace paper-based tests, but they will never replace the reliability paper test brought.</p>
<p>Candidate B: Well, I hoped that the computer-based test can not only provide convenience for exams, but also improve its security and stability.</p>
