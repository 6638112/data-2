<p><strong>Online medical service or offline medical service, which is better?</strong></p>
<p>Nowadays, with the development of Internet and medical technology, it has become a reality that we can stay at home to be medically served online without going to the physical hospital. Personally, I think the online medical service is better that the traditional one for the following three main points.</p>
<p>Firstly, as is known to us, the traditional medical service required that we should not only make an appointment in advance, but also go to the physical hospital to line up for a long time to see the doctor. What’s worse, it takes a few hours for us to get there if we are far from the hospital. Thus, the online one can be said to be better and convenient for us. We can make use of the waiting time to do a lot of meaningful things or get more sleep. Second, as the pandemic of CIVID-19 this year, some measures should be taken to reduce the probability of exposing to the infectious disease. However, if we all go to the physical hospital when we feel a little sick, we can’t guarantee the occurrence of infection since some diseases is contagious itself. Lastly, I suggest that common ailments, such as catching a cold, should be encouraged to be treated online at home, while the unusual cases should be treated in the hospital because sometimes we need to be inspected by the professional medical devices to know our physical condition. </p>

<p>The Importance of Translation</p>
<p>Translation is a cross-language and cross-culture communicative activity. In translation practice, translators should be faithful to the original text, and deal with target language with flexibility, instead of sticking to the original structure. As Eugene Nida said, “Translating consists in reproducing in the receptor language the closest natural equivalent of the source language message, first in terms of meaning, and secondly in terms of style.” Translation plays a key role in a increasingly interdependent world.</p>
<p>With the globalization of the economic, there are more and more global companies, who need the translator when they communicate with their business partner, run a business in a foreign country, and so on. The translator enhance communication by conveying information accurately from one language to another in different countries across the world. </p>
<p>To sum up, translation is not just about academic skills. It is about providing the vital linguistic and cultural link between persons and communities of different races, cultures and languages. So that we can communicate better and understand one another more effectively. </p>

<p>今天是2020年11月22日，大学英语六级口语考试今天举行。大学英语六级口语考试分三个部分，第一部分是自我介绍和问答，第二部分是陈述和讨论，第三部分是问答。本场口语考试讨论的主题为“various tests”，讨论的主要内容是“机考是否将代替纸质考试”以下展示一篇讨论，供考生参考。</p>
<p>Candidate A: Due to the epidemic this year, many paper tests have been converted to computer-based ones. Do you have any ideas about it?</p>
<p>Candidate B: Yeah. I have just taken a computer-based test last month. I think it is very convenient and efficient. I just need to open my computer and do the test.</p>
<p>Candidate A: Well, of course computer-based test can reduce many processes, but does it guarantee fairness and equality of the test? </p>
<p>Candidate B: As far as I am concerned, computer-based test can’t fully guarantee the fairness of the examination. For example, the rural network is worse than the urban network, which is very unfair to the rural candidates.</p>
<p>Candidate A: Yeah, I agree with your idea. In addition, it’s not very safe. If the computer crashes or the Internet is disconnected, the exam will not go smoothly.</p>
<p>Candidate B: What’s more, popularizing the computer-based test is not simple. It requires sufficient funding and technical support. </p>
<p>Candidate A: So, In the future of artificial intelligence, computer-based tests may replace paper-based tests, but they will never replace the reliability paper test brought.</p>
<p>Candidate B: Well, I hoped that the computer-based test can not only provide convenience for exams, but also improve its security and stability.</p>
