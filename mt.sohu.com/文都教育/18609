<p>When my son completes a task, I can’t help but praise him. It’s only natural to give praise where praise is due,right? But is there such a thing as too much praise?According to psychologist Katherine Phillip, children don’t benefit from 26 praise as much as we’d like to think.“Parents often praise, believing they are building their child’s self-confidence.However,over-praising can have a 27 effect,” says Phillip.“When we use the same praise 28 , it may become empty and no longer valued by the child. It can also become an expectation that anything they do must be 29 with praise.This may lead to the child avoiding taking risks due to fear of 30 their parents.”</p>            <div class="lookall-box">

<p>Docs this mean we should do away with all the praise? Phillip says no,“The key to healthy praise is 1o focus on the process rather than the 31 it is the recognition of a child’s attempt, or the process in which they achieved something, that is essential,”she says, “Parents should encourage their child to take the risks needed to learn and grow.”</p>
<p>So how do we break the 32 of praise we’re all so accustomed to? Phillip says it’s important to 33 between “person praise”and “process raise”.“Person praise is 34 saying how great someone is. It’s a form personal approval. Process praise s acknowledgement of the efforts te person has just 35 . Children who receive person praise are more likely to feel shame after losing,” says Phillip.</p>

<p><strong>【四级翻译真题】</strong></p>
<p>鱼是春节前夕餐桌上不可或缺的一道菜，因为汉语中“鱼”字的发音与“余”字的发音相同。正由于这个象征性的意义，春节期间鱼也作为礼物送给亲戚朋友。鱼的象征意义据说源于中国传统文化。中国人有节省的传统，他们认为节省得愈多，就感到愈为安全。今天，尽管人们愈来愈富裕了，但他们仍然认为节省是一种值得弘扬的美德。</p>
<p><strong>【参考译文】</strong></p>
<p>Fish is a very necessary dish on the dinner table on the eve of Spring Festival, for the reason that the “fish” in Chinese sounds the same as the Chinese character “Yu” (which means the amount of grains and money received is greater than the amount you need.) Because of this symbolic meaning, fish are also given as gifts to relatives and friends during the Spring Festival. The symbolic meaning of fish is said to be rooted in traditional Chinese culture. Having a tradition of saving, the Chinese think the more they save, the more secure they feel. Today, although people are getting richer, they still regard saving as a virtue worth promoting.</p>

<p><strong>Part Iwriting</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong> For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic <strong>“Changes in the way of Transportation”</strong> . You should write at least 120 words but no more than 180 words.</p>
<p><strong>参考范文：</strong></p>
<p>With the social and economic development, our means of transportation have changed a lot over the last few decades, which has brought much convenience to our life.</p>
<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, bicycles were the primary means of public transportation. Families that owned a bicycle were thought to be in relatively good economic conditions. Because of the implementation of the reform and opening policy, the economy and people’s living standards were improved a lot and travelling by private cars became more and more common in 1990s and 2000s. And thanks to the information technology, we can now enjoy bike-sharing service and online ride-hailing service which help to make our journey more economical and flexible.</p>
<p>We have enough reason to believe that our way of transportation could be more and more economically friendly and intelligent.</p>            <div class="lookall-box">

<p>A poisonous fish which has a sting strong enough to kill a human is invading the Mediterranean, warned scientists. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (UICN) has raised concerns after the poisonous fish was spotted in the waters around Turkey, Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean.Native to the South Pacific and Indian Ocean, the potentially deadly fish has poisonous hooks and a painful sting capable of killing people.Although fatalities are rare, the stings can cause extreme pain and stop people breathing. The fish,often known as Devil Fire fish, is a highly invasive species.And environmentalists fear its arrival could endanger other types of marine life.After being spotted in the Mediterranean,a marine scientist says,"The fish is spreading,and that's a cause for concern."</p>

<p>A Philippine fisherman was feeling down on his luck when a house fire forced him to clear out his possessions and change locations. Then,a good luck charm that he had kept under his bed changed his life.The unidentified man had fished out a giant pearl from the ocean when his anchor got stuck on the rock while sailing off a coastal island in the Philippines ten years ago.When he was forced to sell it, the shocked tourist agent at Puerto Princesca told him that the 77-pound giant pearl that he had kept hidden in his rundown wooden house was the biggest pearl in the world, which was valued at f76 million.The pearl of Allah, which is currently on display in a New York museum,only weighs 14 pounds.That is five times smaller than the pearl that the fisher man just handed in.The monstrous pearl, measured at1foot wide and 2.2 feet long, is going to be verified by local experts and international authorities before hopefully going on display to attract more tourists in the little town.</p>

<p>MAN: Thank you, Mrs. Houston. I know Astro Consultants is a famous company. But you said you would show me what you could do for me. Well. What exactly can your firm do for my company?</p>
<p>WOMAN: We advise businesses on all matters, from market analysis to legal issues. Anything a business like yours could meet. Our firm offers expert advice. Could I ask you, Mr. Smith, to tell me a little about your company and the challenges you face? That way, I could better respond as to how we can help you.</p>
<p>Man: OK, sure. This is a family business started by my grandfather in 1950. We employ just over 100 people. We manufacture an export stone for buildings and other constructions. Our clients usually want a special kind of stone cut in a special design. And that’s what we do in our factory【9】. Our main challenge is that our national currency is rising, and we’re losing competitive advantages to stone produces in India【10】.</p>
<p>WOMAN: I see. That’s very interesting. I will suggest that you let us first conduct a financial analysis of your company, together with the analysis of your competitors in India.【11】That way, we could offer the best advice on different ways forward for you.</p>

<p>Man: Really? You think so?</p>
<p>W: Of course. I love it. It looks like you had a professional interior designer. But you didn’t, did you?</p>
<p>M: No. I did it all by myself with a little help from my brother, Greg. He’s actually in the construction business, which was really helpful.</p>
<p>W: Honestly, I’m impressed! I know I can probably repaint the walls in my house over a weekend or something, but not a full renovation. Where did you get your ideas? I wouldn’t know where to start.[12]</p>
<p>M: Well, for a while now, I’ve been regularly buying home design magazines. Every now and then, I’d saved the pictures I liked. Believe it or not, I have a full notebook of magazine pages. [13] Since by overall style was quite minimal, I thought and hoped a whole renovation wouldn’t be too difficult. And sure enough, with Greg’s help, it was very achievable.</p>
<p>W: Wasn’t it expensive? I have imagined a project like this could be.</p>
<p>M: Actually, it was surprisingly affordable. I managed to sell a lot of my old furniture and put that extra money towards the new material. [14] Greg was also able to get some discount materials from a recent project he was working on as well.</p>
<p>W: Great! If you don’t mind, I’d like to pick your brain a bit more. Johansson and I are thinking of renovating our sitting room, not the whole house, not yet anyway. And we’d love to get some inspiration from your experience. [15] Are you free to come over for a coffee early next week?</p>

Cotton buds and pencils were also found in ears.[Q17]</p>
<p>According to the study, the occurrence of foreign objects in children is generally attributed to curiosity Children have an impulse to explore their noses and ears. This results in the accidental entry of foreign objects.[Q18]Any ear, nose and throat surgeon has many weird stories about wonderful objects found in the noses and ears of children and adults.Batteries can pose a particular danger.In all cases, prevention is better than cure.

<p><strong>Passage 2</strong></p>
<p>Good morning, I’d like to talk to you about my charity ReBicycle. But before that, let me introduce someone. This is Leila Rahimi. She was so scared when she first moved to New Zeal-and that she struggled to leave the house and would spend days working up the courage to walk to the supermarket for basic supplies. After a few months of being quite down and unhappy, she was invited to join a local bike club. At this time, ReBicycle got involved and gave Leila a second-hand bicycle.[Q19] In weeks, her depression had begun to ease as she cycled. The bicycle totally changed her life, giving her hope and a true feeling of freedom.</p>
<p>To date, ReBicycle has donated more than 200 bikes to those in need, and is now expanding bike-riding lessons as demand soars.[Q20] With a bike, you can travel farther but for almost no cost. The three hours a day that used to spend on walking to and from English language lessons has been reduced to just one hour. Our bike-riding lessons are so successful that we are urgently looking for more volunteers. [Q21] Learning to ride a bike is almost always more difficult as an adult, and this can take days and weeks, rather than hours. So, if any of you have some free time during the weekend, please come join us at Re Bicycle and make a difference in someone’s life.</p>
<p>Q19: What did Re Bicycle do to help Leila Rahimi?</p>
<p>Q20: What is Re Bicycle doing to help those in need? </p>
<p>Q21: What do we learn from the passage about the Re Bicycle?</p>
<p><strong>Passage 3</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the International Space Station we know quite a bit about the effects of low gravity on the human body, but NASA scientists want to learn more. To that end, they have been studying how other species deal with low gravity, specifically focusing on mice（22）. The results are both interesting and humorous.</p>
<p>The scientists first send some mice in a specially designed cage to the International Space Station. The cage allowed them to study the behavior of the mice remotely from Earth via video. As you noticed in the video, the mice definitely seem uncomfortable at the beginning of the experiment. They move around clumsily, drifting within the small confines of the cage and do their best to figure out which way is up, but without success. (23) However, it’s not long before the mice begin to catch on. They adapt remarkably well to their new environment and even using the lack of gravity to their advantage as they push themselves around the cage.</p>
<p>That’s when things really get wild. The 11th day of the experiment shows the mice are not just dealing with the gravity change but actually seem to be enjoying it. (24) Several of the mice are observed running around the cage walls.</p>
<p>The scientists wanted to see whether the mice would continue doing the same kinds of activities they were observed doing on Earth. The study showed that the mice kept much of their routines intact, including cleaning themselves and eating when hungry. (25)</p>

<p>When my son completes a task, I can’t help but praise him. It’s only natural to give praise where praise is due,right? But is there such a thing as too much praise?According to psychologist Katherine Phillip, children don’t benefit from 26 praise as much as we’d like to think.“Parents often praise, believing they are building their child’s self-confidence.However,over-praising can have a 27 effect,” says Phillip.“When we use the same praise 28 , it may become empty and no longer valued by the child. It can also become an expectation that anything they do must be 29 with praise.This may lead to the child avoiding taking risks due to fear of 30 their parents.”</p>
<p>Docs this mean we should do away with all the praise? Phillip says no,“The key to healthy praise is 1o focus on the process rather than the 31 it is the recognition of a child’s attempt, or the process in which they achieved something, that is essential,”she says, “Parents should encourage their child to take the risks needed to learn and grow.”</p>
<p>So how do we break the 32 of praise we’re all so accustomed to? Phillip says it’s important to 33 between “person praise”and “process raise”.“Person praise is 34 saying how great someone is. It’s a form personal approval. Process praise s acknowledgement of the efforts te person has just 35 . Children who receive person praise are more likely to feel shame after losing,” says Phillip.</p>

<p><strong>Section B</strong></p>
<p><strong>Poverty is a story about us, not them</strong></p>
<p>[A] Too often still we think we know the poverty looks like. It's the way we've been taught, the images we’ve been forced-fed decades. The chronically homeless. The undocumented immigrant. The urban poor, usually personified as a woman of color, the"welfare queen" politicians still too often reference.</p>
<p>[B] But as income inequality rises to record levels in the United States, even in the midst of a record economic expansions,.those familiar images are outdated, hurtful and counterproductive to focusing attention on solutions and building ladders of opportunity.</p>
<p>IC] Today 's faces of inequality and lack of opportunity look like all of us. It's Anna Landre, a disabled Georgetown University student fighting to keep health benefits that allow-her the freedom to live her life lt's Tiffanie Standard, a counselor for young women of color in Philadelphia who want to be tech entrepreneurs — but who must work multiple jobs to stay afloat.It's Ken Outlaw, a welder in rural North Carolina whose dream of going back to school at a local community college was dashed by Hurricane Florence-just one of the extreme weather events that have tipped the balance for struggling Americans across the nation,</p>
<p>[D] If these arc the central characters of our story about poverty. what layers of perceptions, myths, and realities must we unearth to find meaningful solutions and support? In pursuit of revealing this complicated reality,Mothering Justice, led by women of color, went last year to the state capital in Lansing, Michigan, to lobby on issues that affect working mothers.One of the Mothering Justice organizers went to the office of a state representative to talk about the lack of affordable childcare - the vestiges (痕迹)) of a system that expected mothers to stay home with their children while their husbands worked, A legislative staffer dismissed the activist’s concerns, telling her“my husband took care of that-l stayed home.”</p>
<p>[E] That comment, says Mothering Justice director Danielle Atkinson., "was meant to shame" and relied on the familiar trope that a woman of color concemed about income inequality and programs that promote mobility must by definition be a single mom, probably with multiple kids.,In this case.Mothering Justice activist happened to be married.And in most cases in the America of 2019, the images that come to mind when we hear the words poverty or income inequality fail miserably in reflecting a complicated reality: poverty touches virtually all of us. The face of income inequality, for all but a very few of us, is the one we each see in the mirror.</p>
<p>[F] How many of us are poor in the U.S.? It depends on who you ask. According to the Census Bureau,38 million people in the U.S. are living below the official poverty thresholds,Taking into account economic need beyond that absolute measure,the Institute for Policy Studies found that 140 million peoplc are poor or low-income. That's almost half the U.S population.</p>
<p>[G] Whatever the measure,within that massive group, poverty is extremely diverse.We know that some people are more affected than others, like children, the elderly, people with disabilities, and people of color.</p>
<p>[H] But the fact that 4 in 10 Americans can't come up with $400 in an emergency is a commonly cited statistic for good reason:economic instability stretches across race, gender, and geography.It even reaches into the middle classes, as real wages have stagnated (不增长) for all but the very wealthy and temporary spells of financial instability are not uncommon.</p>
<p>[I] Negative images remain of who is living in poverty as well as what is needed to move out of it. The big American myth is that you can pull yourself up by your own effort and change a bad situation into a good one. The reality is that finding opportunity without help from families,friends. schools，, and community is virtually impossible.And the playing field is nothing close to level.</p>
<p>[J] The Frame Works institute, a research group that focuses on public framing of issues,has studied what sustains stereotypes and narratives of poverty in the United Kingdom."People view economic success and well being in life as product of choice, willpower, drive, grit, and gumption,"says Nat Kendall-Taylor, CEO of Frame Works. “When we see people who are struggling.” he says, those assumptions “lead us to the perception that people in poverty are lazy. they don’t care, and they haven 't made the right decisions.”</p>
<p>[K] Does this sound familiar? Similar ideas surround poverty in the U.S.And these assumptions wreak havoc on reality."When people enter into that pattern of thinking," says Kendall-Taylor," it 's cognitively comfortable to make sense of issues of poverty in that way. It creates a kind of cognitive blindness - all of the factors external to a person 's drive and choices that they've made become invisible and fade from view.”</p>
<p>Those external factors include the difficulties accompanying low-wage work ot struetual discrimination based on race,gender, or ability. Assumptions get worse when people who are poor use government benefits to help them survive. There is a great tension between "the poor" and those who are receiving what has become a dirty word:"welfare."</p>
<p>According to the General Social Survey, 7l percent of respondents believe the contry is spending too little on a"welfare":37 percent believe we are spending too much,</p>
<p>[N] "Poverty has been interchangeable with people of color - specifically black women and black mothers," says Atkinson of Mothering Justice. It's true that black mothers are more affected by poverty than many other groups,yet they are disproportionately the face of poverty.For example，Americans routinely overestimate the share of black recipients of public assistance programs.</p>
<p>[O] In reality, most people will experience some form of financial hardship at some point in their lives. Indeed, people tend to dip in and out of poverty,perhaps due to unexpected obstacles like losing a job,or when hours of a low-wage job fluctuate.</p>
<p>[P] Something each of us can do is to treat each other with the dignity and sympathy that is deserved and to understand deeply that the issue of poverty touches all of us.</p>

<p><strong>Section C</strong></p>
<p><strong>Passage One</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.</strong></p>
<p>Boredom has,paradoxically, become quite interesting to academics lately.In early May.London's Boring Conference celebrated seven years of delighting in dullness.At this event.people flocked to talks about weather, traffic jams and vending-machine sounds.,among other sleep-inducing topics What, exactly, is everybody studying? One widely accepted definition of boredom is "the distasteful experience of wanting, but being unable. to engage in satisfying activity."</p>
<p>But how can you quantify a person's boredom level and compare it with someone else’ s?</p>
<p>In1986, psychologists introduced the Boredom Proneness Scale, designed to measure an individual’s overall tendency to feel bored By contrast, the Mulitidimensional State Boredom scale,developed in 2008, measures a person’s feelings of boredom in a given situation.</p>
<p>Boredom has been linked to behavior issues including inattentive driving.mindless snacking.excessive drinking,and and addictive gambling.In fact, many of us would choose pain over boredom.</p>
<p>One team of psychologists discovered that two-thirds of men and a quarter of women would rather self-administer electric shocks than sit alone with their thoughts for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Researching this phenomenon, another team asked volunteers to watch boring.sad, or ncutar films,during which they could self-administer elccrie shocks, The bored volunteers shocked themselves more and harder than the sad or neutral ones did.</p>
<p>But boredom isn't all bad. By encouraging self-reflection and daydreaming.it can spur activity.An early study gave participants abundant time to complete problem-solving and word-association exercises.Once all the obvious answers were exhausted, participants gave more and more incentive answers to combat boredom: A British study took these findings one step further, asking subjects to complete a creative challenge (coming up with a list of alternative uses for a household item).One group of subjects did a boring activity first. while the others went straight to the creative task.Those whose boredom pumps had been primed were more productive.</p>
<p>In our always connected world,boredom may be a hard-to-define state,but it is a fertile one,Watch paint dry or water boil, or at least put away our smart phone for a while,and you might unlock your next big idea.</p>
<p>46. When are people likely to experience boredom, according to an accepted psychological definition?</p>
<p><strong>A) When they don’t have the chance to do what they want.</strong></p>
<p>B) When they don’t enjoy the materials they are studying.</p>
<p>C) When they experience something unpleasant.</p>
<p>D) When they engage in some routine activities.</p>
<p>47. What does the author say boredom can lead to?</p>
<p>A) Determination</p>
<p>B) Mental deterioration</p>
<p>C) Concentration</p>
<p><strong>D) Harmful conduct</strong></p>
<p>48. What is the findings of one team of psychologists in their experiment?</p>
<p>A) Volunteers prefer watching a boring movie to sitting alone deliberating.</p>
<p><strong>B) Many volunteers choose to hurt themselves rather than endure boredom.</strong></p>
<p>C) Male volunteers arc more immune to the effects of boredom than females.</p>
<p>D) Many volunteers are unable to resist boredom longer than fifteen minutes .</p>
<p>49. Why does the author say boredom isn’t all bad?</p>
<p>A) It stimulates memorization.</p>
<p>B) It may promote creative thinking.</p>
<p><strong>C) It allows time for relaxation.</strong></p>
<p>D) It may facilitate independent learning.</p>
<p>50. What does the author suggests one do when faced with a challenging problem?</p>
<p>A) stop idling and think big.</p>
<p>B) Unlock one’s smart phone.</p>
<p>C) Look around oneself for stimulation.</p>
<p><strong>D) Allow oneself some time to be bored.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Passage Two</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.</strong></p>
<p>Forests in countries like Brazil and the Congo get a lot of attention from environmentalists, and it is easy to see why. South America and sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing deforestation on an enormous scale: every year almost s million hectares are lost. But forests are also changing in rich Western countries They are growing larger, both in the sense that they occupy more and that the tees in them and bigger. What is going on?</p>
<p>Forests are spreading in almost all Western countries, with fastest growth in places that historically had rather few tress. In 1990 28% of Spain was forested; now the proportion is 37%. In both Greece and Italy, the growth was from 26% to 32% </p>
<p>over the same period. Forests are gradually taking more and in America and Australia. Perhaps most astonishing is the trend in Ireland. Roughly 1% of that country was forested when it became independent in 1922. Forests cover 11% of the land, and the governments wants to push the proportion to 18% by the 2040s.</p>
<p>Two things are fertilizing this growth. The first is the abandonment of farmland, especially in high, dry places where nothing grows terribly well. When farmers give up trying to earn a living from farming or herding trees simply move in.The second is governments policy and subsidy. Throughout history, governments have protected and promoted forests for diverse reasons, ranging from the need for wooden warships to a desire to promote suburban house-building. Nowadays forests are increasingly welcome because they suck in carbon pollution from the air. The justifications change; the desire for more trees remains constant,</p>
<p>The greening of the West does not delight everyone. Farmers complain that land is being taken out of use by generously subsidized tree plantations. Parts of Spain and Portugal suffer from terrible forest fires. Others simply dislike the appearance of forests planted in neat rows. They will have to get used to the trees, however. The growth of Western forests seems almost as unstoppable as deforestation elsewhere.</p>
<p>51. What is catching environmentalists’ attention nowadays?</p>
<p>A) Rich countries are stripping poor ones of their resources.</p>
<p><strong>B) Forests are fast shrinking in many developing countries.</strong></p>
<p>C) Forests are eating away the fertile farmland worldwide.</p>
<p>D) Rich countries are doing little to address deforestation.</p>
<p>52. Which countries have the fastest forest growth?</p>
<p>A)Those that brave newly achieved independence.</p>
<p>B) Those that at have the greatest demand for timber</p>
<p><strong>C)Those that used to have the lowest forest coverage.</strong></p>
<p>D) Those that provide enormous government subsidies.</p>
<p>53. What has encouraged forest growth historically?</p>
<p><strong>A)The government’s advocacy.</strong></p>
<p>B)The use of wood for fuel.</p>
<p>C) The favorable climate.</p>
<p>D) The green movement.</p>
<p>54. What account for our increasing desire for forests?</p>
<p>A) Their unique scenic beauty.</p>
<p>B) Their use as fruit plantation.</p>
<p><strong>C) Their capability of improving air quality.</strong></p>
<p>D) Their stable supply of building materials.</p>
<p>55. What docs the author conclude about the prospects of forestation?</p>
<p>A) Deserts in sub-Saharan Africa will diminish gradually.</p>
<p>B) It will play a more and more important role in people’s lives.</p>
<p>C) Forest destruction in the developing world will quickly slow down.</p>
<p><strong>D) Developed and developing countries are moving in opposite direction</strong></p>
