<p>本场的个人陈述话题是：校园里应不应该停放车辆，以及对校园里停放越来越多的车辆有什么看法。这个话题非常贴近生活，有很多内容可谈。考生只需把自己的观点陈述出来，逻辑清晰即可。下面是一篇范文，供各位考生参考。</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are a lot of such phenomena on campus: a lot of private cars parked on the roads, which brings great inconvenience to students and teachers. So should cars be parked on campus? As far as I am concerned, first, there should be fixed parking spaces on campus and car owners should park their cars on them. Second, if a car owner misplaces the car, which affects the travel of students and teachers, the university should investigate the severity and impose a fine. This would encourage owners to put their cars in the right places and penalize those who leave them in the wrong places. In addition, unregistered vehicles are prohibited from entering the campus. These vehicles will not only affect the campus environment, but also threaten the safety of students. In a word, the campus is a place for students who need a clean environment and quiet atmosphere to ensure that they are fully engaged in their study. Therefore, the problem of disorderly parking needs to be dealt with seriously.</p>
