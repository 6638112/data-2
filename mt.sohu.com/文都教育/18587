<p>In recent years, the global epidemic situation of infectious diseases is very serious. Although the incidence of many infectious diseases has decreased significantly, infectious diseases are still the main threat to human health in the world.This year’s covid-19 pandemic, for example, killed thousands of people. I have to say that prevention and control of infectious diseases are very important. First, with globalization, the world is now a village. If there is an infectious disease, it will spread to every corner of the world very quickly. Secondly, infectious diseases are highly contagious and spread quickly, posing a serious threat to people’s health and life safety. Finally, infectious diseases, once widespread, can overwhelm health systems and affect other basic systems. If not prevented, it will have a serious impact on the stability of the whole society. So we need to prevent and control infectious diseases and reduce their impact on people’s health and society.</p>

<p>B: It’s not a easy job, I must say. Actually, I’m perplexed by several issues which are brought by the limited budget. First is the venue. The five-star hotel I planned to choose is no longer available and I’m afraid if I can find another good place for the event in such a short time.</p>
<p>A: Well, I remember yesterday when I browsed the local newspaper, I saw an advertisement of a book store open for bushiness. It has a big fancy lobby which is pretty good for the event and the price is reasonable. </p>
<p>B: That would be great! I’ll try to get in touch with the manager and talk to him. By the way, could you do me a favor to send this invitation to professor Lee in your university? He is the authority of the subject, and we all hope he can come to the event to give a lecture.</p>
<p>A: No problem. He is also my idol and his lectures are very popular among us students.</p>
<p>B: That would be very nice of you! The event is scheduled to be held in December 12th. I will save you several entrance tickets for you and your friends!</p>
<p>A: Ha ha thank you!</p>
