<p>In recent years, the global epidemic situation of infectious diseases is very serious. Although the incidence of many infectious diseases has decreased significantly, infectious diseases are still the main threat to human health in the world.This year’s covid-19 pandemic, for example, killed thousands of people. I have to say that prevention and control of infectious diseases are very important. First, with globalization, the world is now a village. If there is an infectious disease, it will spread to every corner of the world very quickly. Secondly, infectious diseases are highly contagious and spread quickly, posing a serious threat to people’s health and life safety. Finally, infectious diseases, once widespread, can overwhelm health systems and affect other basic systems. If not prevented, it will have a serious impact on the stability of the whole society. So we need to prevent and control infectious diseases and reduce their impact on people’s health and society.</p>

➜11月大学英语四级口语考试个人陈述——the importance of saving money

<p>本场<strong>四级口语考试</strong>的话题是存钱的重要性。鉴于当今恶劣的经济形势及潜在的风险，存钱变得尤为重要，它不仅可以应对短期危机，也能为养老提供保障。<strong>文都四六级老师</strong>为大家奉献一篇范文，供考生参考。</p>
<p>In terms of current depressed economic situation and potential risk, saving certain money seems to be agreed widely. The primary reason is to avoid short-term financial burden. When laid off or suffering from accidents and sickness, citizens have to take out sufficient money in order to go through the storm. </p>
<p>On this condition, the money saved in advance matters a lot. Besides, after retiring, the elderly need abundant material resources to support themselves, so accumulating almost half of their salary from adulthood plays a significant role. Generally speaking, it is necessary to make budgets at the start of a month, which ensures that they can not only live a better life, but collect plenty of money. </p>
<p>All in all, having a plan and following the schedule can do nothing but help you out in the long run. </p>

<p class="ql-align-center"> Promote Life Skills for Middle School Students</p>
<p>Education is about giving people the opportunity to develop their potential, their personality and their strengths. This does not merely mean learning new knowledge，but also developing abilities to make the most of life. These are called life skills-- including the inner capacities and the practical skills. We need to increase our life skills at every stage of life, especially the secondary education when students are in the stage of building their personality. </p>
<p>For one thing, practical life skills are the kinds of manual skills the middle students need for the physical tasks they face. These are skills which are often available to middle school students leaving school. For another, in today's world all these skills are necessary, in order to face rapid change in society. They need to know how to cope with the flood of information and turn it into useful knowledge. They also need to learn how to handle changes in society and in their own lives.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the middle school students should recognize the importance of life skills--both practical and psycho-social---as part of education which leads to the full development of human potential and to the development of society.</p>
