<p>With the continuous progress of science and technology, great changes have taken place in the way people communicate. The influence of these changes are discussed as follows.</p>
<p>Since the reform and opening up, people have been communicating in the following ways: letters, telegrams, telephone and mobile phones. After entering the 21st century, the appearance of smart phones has brought great changes. First of all, there is no denying that the change of communication mode has brought great convenience to people. Smart phones enabled video communication, and online shopping became popular after its appearance. Second, however, it also brought a lot of adverse effects. For example, the emergence of smart phones have made many people addicted to the virtual world, which not only delayed their study and work, but also affected their family harmony.</p>
<p>In a word, it is inevitable that the development of science and technology will change the way of communication, which will bring a lot of influence to people’s life.

<p>With the social and economic development, our means of transportation have changed a lot over the last few decades, which has brought much convenience to our life.</p>
<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, bicycles were the primary means of public transportation. Families that owned a bicycle were thought to be in relatively good economic conditions. Because of the implementation of the reform and opening policy, the economy and people’s living standards were improved a lot and travelling by private cars became more and more common in 1990s and 2000s. And thanks to the information technology, we can now enjoy bike-sharing service and online ride-hailing service which help to make our journey more economical and flexible.</p>
<p>We have enough reason to believe that our way of transportation could be more and more economically friendly and intelligent.</p>

<p><strong>四级作文（三）</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong> For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic <strong>“</strong> <strong>Changes in the way of Education”</strong> . You should write at least 120 words but no more than 180 words.</p>
<p><strong>范文</strong></p>
<p>Along with the development of the society, people’s views on many matters have been changed greatly. In the past, multiple problems existed in school education and family education. But nowadays, so many things have been totally different. </p>
<p>As for school education, the schools traditionally adopted exam-oriented mode regarding the students’ education and failed to pay much attention to other aspects, like quality education. However, this has been altered. The schools have made great efforts to promote all-around development of students, aiming to cultivate more excellent talents. Meanwhile, referring to home education, many children were forced to attend many interest-oriented classes that they hated, making them bear so much extra burden. But now, a large number of parents have changed their mind, for example, they encourage their children to choose the interest-oriented class, and endow more freedom to them. </p>
<p>All in all, lots of changes have taken place in school education and family education. I believe that in the future plenty of things will be better than now, including the current education.</p>
<p>随着社会的发展，人们对许多事情的看法发生了很大的变化。过去，学校教育和家庭教育存在多重问题。但现在，很多事情都完全不同了。</p>
<p>在学校教育方面，传统上学校对学生的教育采取应试教育模式，而忽视了素质教育等其他方面。然而，这一点已经改变了。学校努力促进学生的全面发展，培养更多的优秀人才。同时，在家庭教育方面，许多孩子被迫参加许多他们讨厌的兴趣导向的课程，使他们承担了太多额外的负担。但是现在，很多家长改变了主意，比如鼓励孩子选择兴趣班，给孩子更多的自由。</p>
<p>总之，学校教育和家庭教育发生了许多变化。我相信在未来很多事情都会比现在好，包括现在的教育。</p>

<p>春节前夕吃团圆饭是中国人的传统。团圆饭是一年中最重要的晚餐，也是家庭团聚的最佳时机，家人生活在不同地方的家庭尤其如此。团圆饭上的菜肴丰富多样，其中有些菜肴有特殊含义。例如，鱼是不可缺少的一道菜，因为汉语中的“鱼”字和“余”字听上一样。在中国的许多地方，饺子也是一道重要的佳肴，因为饺子象征着财富和好运。</p>
<p><strong>【四级翻译参考译文】</strong></p>
<p>It is a Chinese tradition to have a family reunion dinner on the eve of the Spring Festival. The reunion dinner is the most important dinner of the year and the best time for family reunion, especially for families living in different places. The dishes served at the reunion dinner are rich and varied, some of which have special meanings. Fish, for example, is an indispensable dish, because the Chinese word for fish (鱼) sounds the same as the word for surplus (余). In many parts of China, dumplings are also an important delicacy because they symbolize wealth and good luck.</p>

<p>When my son completes a task, I can’t help but praise him. It’s only natural to give praise where praise is due,right? But is there such a thing as too much praise?According to psychologist Katherine Phillip, children don’t benefit from 26 praise as much as we’d like to think.“Parents often praise, believing they are building their child’s self-confidence.However,over-praising can have a 27 effect,” says Phillip.“When we use the same praise 28 , it may become empty and no longer valued by the child. It can also become an expectation that anything they do must be 29 with praise.This may lead to the child avoiding taking risks due to fear of 30 their parents.”</p>            <div class="lookall-box">

<p>Docs this mean we should do away with all the praise? Phillip says no,“The key to healthy praise is 1o focus on the process rather than the 31 it is the recognition of a child’s attempt, or the process in which they achieved something, that is essential,”she says, “Parents should encourage their child to take the risks needed to learn and grow.”</p>
<p>So how do we break the 32 of praise we’re all so accustomed to? Phillip says it’s important to 33 between “person praise”and “process raise”.“Person praise is 34 saying how great someone is. It’s a form personal approval. Process praise s acknowledgement of the efforts te person has just 35 . Children who receive person praise are more likely to feel shame after losing,” says Phillip.</p>

<p>The things people make, and the way they make them, determine how cities grow and decline,and influence how empires rise and fall. So, any disruption to the world' s factories 26 .</p>
<p>And that disruption is surely coming. Factories are being digitised, filled with new sensors and new computers to make them quicker, more 27 , and more efficient.</p>
<p>Robots are breaking free from the cages that surround them, learning new sill,, and new ways of working. And 3D printers have long 28 a world where you can make anything, any-where, from a computerized design. That vision is 29 closer to reality. These forces will lead to cleaner factories, producing better goods at lower prices, personalized to our individual needs and desires. Humans will be 30 many of the dirty, repetitive, and dangerous jobs that have long been a 31 of factory life.</p>
<p>Greater efficiency 32 means fewer people can do the same work. Yet factory bosses in many developed countries are worried about a lack of skilled human workers -and see 33 and robots as a solution.</p>
<p>But economist Helena Leurent says this period of rapid change in manufacturing is a 34 opportunity to make the world a better place. “Manufacturing is the one system where you have got the biggest source of innovation,the biggest source of economic growth, and the biggest source of great jobs in the past.”You can see it changing. That’s an opportunity to 35 that system differently and if we can,it will have enormous significance.”</p>

<p>Trust is fundamental to lie. If you cannot trust in anything,life becomes intolerable a constant battle against paranoia and looming disaster.You can't have relationships without trust ,let alone good ones.Intimacy depends on it.I suspect more marriages are wrecked by lack of trust than by actual infidelity. The partner who can't trust the other not to betray him or her will either drive them away or force them into some real or assumed act of faithlessness.</p>
<p>In the workplace too, trust is essential. An organization without trust will be full of backstabbing,fear and paranoid suspicion. If you work for a boss who doesn't trust her people to do things right, you'll have a miserable time of it . She 'll be cheeking up on you all the time, correcting"mistakes"and"oversights" and constantly reminding you to do this or that. Colleagues who don't trust one another will need to spend more time watching their backs than doing any useful work. The office politics would make Machiavelli blush.</p>
<p>All this extra work—plus the work we load onto ourselves because we don't trust people either. The cheeking,following through,doing things ourselves because we don’t believe others will do them properly—or at all . If you took all that way,how much extra time would you suddenly find in your day? How much of your work pressure would disappear?</p>

<p>Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, with a total length of 55 kilometers, is an extraordinary engineering feat in our country. By connecting three cities together, it is the longest sea-crossing bridge and tunnel system in the world. The bridge cuts the road travel time among three cities from three hours to thirty minutes. The huge span of the reinforced concrete bridge fully proves Chinese ability to build the record megastructure. It will boost both regional integration and economic growth. The bridge is crucial for China to develop its own master plan for the Greater Bay Area, which is expected to rival San Francisco Bay Area, New York Bay Area and Tokyo Bay Area in terms of technological innovation and economic prosperity.</p>

<p>Qinghai-Tibet Railway is the highest and longest plateau railway in the world, with a total length of 1,956 kilometers, of which 960 kilometers is above the altitude of 4,000 meters. It is the first railway to connect Tibet to other areas of China. As it crosses the most fragile eco-system in the world, ecological protection measures have been taken during and after construction to ensure that it becomes a “green railway”. The Qinghai-Tibet railway has largely shortened the travel time between Chinese mainland and Tibet. More importantly, it has greatly promoted Tibet’s economic development and improved the lives of local residents. After the opening of the railway, an increasing number of people choose to go to Tibet by train, in order to take the opportunity to enjoy the beautiful scenery on the way</p>

Construction of this giant project started in 2014, with more than 40,000 workers on the construction site during peak periods. The terminal building was designed to be very compact, which allowed the maximum number of planes to be docked directly near the center of the terminal, providing great convenience to passengers. There are 82 gates in the terminal building, but passengers can reach any of them in less than eight minutes after passing through the security check. The airport is designed to handle 300 takeoffs and landings per hour. The annual passenger volume of the airport will reach 100 million in 2040, which is expected to make it the busiest airport in the world.</p>
