<p>Autumn years</p>
<p>Someone's autumn years are the later years of their life, especially after they have stopped working.</p>
<p>有些人的autumn years指他们生命中的晚年，尤指退休后的。</p>
<p>This period is likened to autumn since autumn is close to the end of the year (as an elderly person is close to the end of his life) and summer is already gone (just as an elderly person's best years are in the past).</p>
<p>这个时期被比作秋天，因为秋天接近一年的结束(也因为老年人接近生命的尽头)，而夏天已经过去(就像老年人最好的时光已经过去)。</p>
<p>例：</p>
<p>In his autumn years, Peter was able to enjoy his garden a lot more.</p>
<p>到了晚年，彼得可以在他的花园享受了。</p>
